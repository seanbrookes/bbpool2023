# bbpool2021
Annual friends baseball pool site.

Note to self: use Google sheets  for the draft/protected list

It hosts 4 teams with protected rosters between seasons and then facilitates a draft before the season to fill out unprotected positions in each roster.

Players are mapped to player id properties from the mlb stats db.

On demand the latest stats are pulled from the api and a React context state store is created and cached for the duration of the visit.

Each roster is comprised of top players at each of the main positions scoring based on key stats
hitters: runs, hits, HR's, rbi, sb
starters: wins, losses, and k's
closers: wins, saves, k's

Hosted using Vercel app hosting - pretty slick

## Developing locally
This is a Next js application so has a built in server / api  
The api uses the same host and port with the path `/api/...`  
Note this is only for local development as there is no api in production as there is no persistence.  

### isHiddenOn
is the switch to turn on local editing controls in index.js
```
  const [isHiddenOn, setIsHiddenOn] = useState(true);
```

```
hiiter total calc:
      totalVal = (baseValObj.r) + (baseValObj.h / 2) + (baseValObj.rbi) + (baseValObj.hr * 2) + (baseValObj.sb / 2);

      starter totals:
       totalVal = ((baseValObj.w * 15) - (baseValObj.l * 4) + (baseValObj.k / 2));

       closer totals
           totalVal = (baseValObj.sv * 7) + (baseValObj.w * 6) + (baseValObj.k / 2) + (baseValObj.ip / 2);


```


special note of appreciation for mlb to be ok with small fish to access their stats api.
